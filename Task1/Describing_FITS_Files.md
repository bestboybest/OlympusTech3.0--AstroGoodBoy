- **Name:** Ring Nebula (M57) + IC 1296 (galaxy)
- **Type:** Planetary Nebula
- **Astrophysical significance:** This image shows the ring nebula, with a classic ring shape. You can also see the IC 1296 galaxy in the pic, but interestingly, the galaxy is actually very far away compared to the ring nebula, just happens to be seen in this line of sight

## Q6)

- **Name:** Dumbbell Nebula/ Apple Core Nebula (M27/NGC 6853)
- **Type:** Planetary Nebula
- **Astrophysical significance:** This image shows the beautiful Dumbbell Nebula or Apple Core nebula (M27). It was the first planetary nebula, discovered by Charles Messier. It has a distinct dumbbell or apple core shape.

## Q8)
